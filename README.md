## Introduction:
While Gaussian Splatting is powerful, integrating it into professional workflows has been challenging. 3DGS Render bridges this gap, bringing Gaussian Splat handling directly into Blender. Now you can:
1. Work with 3DGS content in a familiar environment
2. Edit and optimize point clouds before 3DGS conversion
3. Create animations and motion graphics
4. Objects react to lighting and cast shadows
   
About version 4.0:

Version 4.0 of the add-on features a whole new real-time rendering mode

A lot of our existing functions, such as modifiers or colour editing, are exactly the same as previous versions (3.0 and below).

The additional core functions of version 4.0 are currently covered as part of our Youtube tutorial videos.

This written documentation will be updated with 4.0 features at a later date.

## Installation:
❗❗Please note❗❗ 
The addon was made for the most current version of Blender at the time of writing. The addon should be capable of 4.2 and later, and will NOT work with previous versions of Blender. 
The addon works with 3DGS .PLY files. You will get errors an loss of functionality with non-3DGS .PLY files.
The Mesh-2-3DGS features work on Windows only and require a specific file/folder structure.

**DO NOT try to download the addon from 'Code...Download ZIP' button.**
Some files were too large to upload and so some files are missing. This will cause errors regarding a missing .Blend file.
**Download from the 'Releases' section.**

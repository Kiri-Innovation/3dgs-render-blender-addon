## Introduction:
While Gaussian Splatting is powerful, integrating it into professional workflows has been challenging. 3DGS Render bridges this gap, bringing Gaussian Splat handling directly into Blender. Now you can:
1. Work with 3DGS content in a familiar environment
2. Edit and optimize point clouds before 3DGS conversion
3. Create animations and motion graphics
4. Objects react to lighting and cast shadows
   
About version 4.0:

Version 4.0 of the add-on features a whole new real-time rendering mode

A lot of our existing functions, such as modifiers or colour editing, are exactly the same as previous versions (3.0 and below).

Full use is covered in the written documentation.

The additional core functions and use of version 4.0 are covered as part of a short Youtube update video.

Be mindful that watching older Youtube videos may show deprecated features or UI elements.
